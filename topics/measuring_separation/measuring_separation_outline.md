# Measuring Separation - Lecture Outline

## Overview
Explore different methods for measuring class separation and data clustering quality, from basic distance metrics to sophisticated dimensionality reduction techniques, with special emphasis on how these measures behave in high-dimensional spaces.

## Learning Objectives
