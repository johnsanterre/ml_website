# ML Topics Resource Library

This directory contains an extensive library of standalone machine learning topic modules with comprehensive teaching materials.

## Structure

Contains 32+ individual ML topic directories including:

### Core Algorithms
- linear_regression, k_nearest_neighbors, decision_trees
- neural_networks, gradient_descent, backpropagation

### Ensemble & Optimization
- boosting_bagging, regularization, cross_validation
- learning_rate_schedulers, search_algorithms

### Deep Learning Architectures
- cnn_architectures, lstm_time_series, transformers
- autoencoders, generative_adversarial_networks

### Advanced Topics
- recommendation_systems, text_embeddings
- dimensionality_reduction, measuring_separation
- bayesian_methods, automl

### Algorithms & Techniques
- tsne_algorithm, umap_algorithm
- time_series_quirks

## Content Format

Each topic directory typically contains:
- `{topic}_outline.md` - Topic structure and learning objectives
- `{topic}_script.md` - Detailed teaching script with explanations
- `{topic}_slides.html` - HTML presentation slides

## Supporting Files

- `template.html` - HTML template for slides (16KB)
- `topics.txt` - List/index of all available topics
- `prompt.txt` - Content generation prompt
- `prompt_lecture.txt` - Lecture generation prompt
- `prompt_script.txt` - Script generation prompt
- `prompt_slides.txt` - Slides generation prompt
- `Summeary_prompt_1.txt` - Summary generation prompt

## Purpose

This library serves as:
- Modular teaching resources for ML courses
- Reference material for specific ML concepts
- Source content for generating course materials
- Reusable components for custom curricula
- Template-based content generation system

## Content Generation

Topics are generated using a template-driven system with prompts that create:
1. Structured outlines defining topic scope
2. Detailed teaching scripts with explanations and examples
3. Visual HTML slide presentations

## Usage

These materials can be:
- Integrated into ML1, ML2, or other courses
- Used for standalone topic instruction
- Referenced for deep dives into specific algorithms
- Adapted for custom course arrangements
- Generated into various output formats
