# Machine Learning Lecture Creation Guidelines

When creating machine learning lecture materials, follow this structured approach:

## File Structure
Create three files for each lecture topic in `topics/[topic_name]/`:
- `[topic_name]_outline.md` - Structured 15-minute lecture outline
- `[topic_name]_slides.html` - Interactive HTML slides with visualizations
- `[topic_name]_script.md` - Detailed spoken script for each slide

## Outline Format (outline.md)
- 6-7 main sections, each 2-3 minutes
- Start with Introduction (2 min) and end with Key Takeaways
- Use bullet points for sub-topics
- Focus on practical, actionable content
- Include learning objectives in introduction

## Slides Format (slides.html)
- 10 slides total including title slide
- Compact design: 85vw width, 75vh height, 30px padding
- Typography: h1 (2.2rem), h2 (1.7rem), h3 (1.2rem), p (0.9rem)
- NO SCROLLING: All content must fit within viewport
- NO colored boxes (warning, danger, do/dont with colors)
- Use neutral styling: .highlight and .example boxes only
- Replace large tables with concise summary text
- Remove "bottom boxes" that add extra length
- Inline formulas instead of separate .formula boxes
- Include simple D3.js visualizations where helpful
- Navigation with keyboard arrows and slide counter

## Script Format (script.md)
- Detailed speaking notes for each slide (280-300 words per slide)
- Natural, conversational tone
- Include slide transitions and key emphasis points
- Provide technical depth beyond what's on slides
- Real-world examples and practical applications

## Content Guidelines
- Focus on practical ML concepts, not just theory
- Include common pitfalls and best practices
- Use business-relevant examples
- Balance technical depth with accessibility
- Emphasize actionable insights over academic completeness

## Design Constraints
- All slides must fit in viewport without scrolling
- Consistent, clean, professional styling
- Minimal color usage (blue highlights only)
- Compact spacing and margins
- Grid layouts for organization
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

## Topics to Favor
- Specific techniques and algorithms
- Practical implementation challenges
- Common mistakes and how to avoid them
- Real-world applications and case studies
- Tool-specific knowledge (XGBoost, LSTM, etc.)
- Domain-specific considerations (time series, NLP, etc.)
