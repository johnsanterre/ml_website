# Text Embeddings and Natural Language Processing

## Learning Objectives
- Understand how text is converted into numerical representations
- Learn about different embedding techniques from bag-of-words to modern transformers
- Understand the concept of semantic similarity in vector spaces
- Learn practical applications of text embeddings
- Understand the evolution from word-level to sentence-level embeddings

## Outline (15-minute lecture)

### 1. Introduction to Text Representation
- The challenge: computers need numbers, not words
- From symbolic to distributed representations
- What makes a good text representation?

### 2. Traditional Approaches
- Bag of Words (BoW) representation
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- Limitations of sparse representations
- Curse of dimensionality

### 3. Word Embeddings Fundamentals
- Dense vector representations
- Word2Vec: Skip-gram and CBOW architectures
- GloVe: Global vectors for word representation
- Key properties: semantic similarity, analogies

### 4. Contextual Embeddings
- Limitations of static word embeddings
- ELMo: Embeddings from Language Models
- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations
- Context-dependent word meanings

### 5. Sentence and Document Embeddings
- Moving beyond word-level representations
- Averaging vs. learned representations
- Sentence-BERT and Universal Sentence Encoder
- Document-level embeddings

### 6. Modern Transformer Embeddings
- Attention mechanisms and self-attention
- GPT and BERT families
- Large language model embeddings
- Instruction-tuned embeddings

### 7. Applications and Use Cases
- Semantic search and information retrieval
- Text classification and sentiment analysis
- Clustering and topic modeling
- Recommendation systems

### 8. Key Takeaways
- Evolution from sparse to dense representations
- Context matters: static vs. contextual embeddings
- Trade-offs between complexity and performance
- Choosing the right embedding for your task
